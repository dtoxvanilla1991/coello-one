# Copilot Instruction Set

- Honor the Coello mobile-first mandate: prioritise the smallest breakpoint for every change, then enhance tablet and desktop once the handheld experience is validated.
- Prefer Ant Design components and Tailwind utilities; justify any divergence in code comments and project notes.
- Maintain the header background as white.
- Before touching any test files, inspect `coello-one/test-setup.ts` and reuse the shared mocks/utilities rather than recreating them.
